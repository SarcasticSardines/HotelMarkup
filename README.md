Desktop site: The site looks nice and you're pretty close to the mockup! When you mouse over the navbar elements, the text color changes and they disappear. The hero image text box background is a little large. I had this same problem and couldn't figure out how to fix it. Your cards look good, but the spacing between them is a little larger than the mockup. Your packages section looks great! The amenities images aren't quite centered, but the sizing is good. Nice job on the form and the image below.
Tablet site: The navbar expand button is hard to see since the color is similar to the background color, but I like how the navbar items are centered in the column when you expand it. The responsiveness on the hamster's paradise, cards, and amenities columns aren't quite there, but you're on the right track and it's a pretty easy fix with column sizing breakpoints. The packages section seems a little hectic with the way the 2nd and 3rd images are back to back. You could try hiding those images to make it a little less cluttered. 
Mobile site: The mobile responsiveness is good! I like the layout of everything, but just like the tablet site I think the packages section is a little cluttered with the images. I like how you hid the text on the amenities section on the mobile site. I think if you could center the card columns on mobile that would be awesome.
Overall, good job! You're in a really good spot. Just a few small tweaks and you're golden.
